Hey, I'm Michael Johnston, a GitHub enthusiast passionate about coding and collaboration. 
With a love for problem-solving, I dive into projects ranging from arduino to automation. 
GitHub is my virtual workshop where I experiment, learn, and contribute to open-source projects. 
Always eager to connect with like-minded developers, I believe in the power of teamwork and community-driven innovation. 
Let's code together and make an impact in the world of software development!
